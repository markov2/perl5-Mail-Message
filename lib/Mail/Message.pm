=chapter DESCRIPTION

A C<Mail::Message> object is a container for MIME-encoded message information,
as defined by RFC2822.  Everything what is not specificaly related to storing
the messages in mailboxes (folders) is implemented in this class.  Methods
which are related to folders is implemented in the M<Mail::Box::Message>
extension.

The main methods are M<get()>, to get information from a message header
field, and M<decoded()> to get the intended content of a message.
But there are many more which can assist your program.

Complex message handling, like construction of replies and forwards, are
implemented in separate packages which are autoloaded into this class.
This means you can simply use these methods as if they are part of this class.
Those package add functionality to all kinds of message objects.

=chapter METHODS

=section Constructors

=cut

our $crlf_platform = $^O =~ m/win32/i;

#------------------------------------------

=c_method new %options

=option  body OBJECT
=default body undef

Instantiate the message with a body which has been created somewhere
before the message is constructed.  The OBJECT must be a sub-class
of Mail::Message::Body.  See also M<body()> and M<storeBody()>.

=option  body_type CLASS
=default body_type M<Mail::Message::Body::Lines>

Default type of body to be created for M<readBody()>.

=option  head OBJECT
=default head undef

Instantiate the message with a head which has been created somewhere
before the message is constructed.  The OBJECT must be a (sub-)class
of M<Mail::Message::Head>. See also M<head()>.

=option  field_type CLASS
=default field_type undef

=option  head_type CLASS
=default head_type M<Mail::Message::Head::Complete>

Default type of head to be created for M<readHead()>.

=option  messageId STRING
=default messageId undef

The id on which this message can be recognized.  If none specified and
not defined in the header --but one is needed-- there will be one assigned
to the message to be able to pass unique message-ids between objects.

=option  modified BOOLEAN
=default modified <false>

Flags this message as being modified from the beginning on.  Usually,
modification is auto-detected, but there may be reasons to be extra
explicit.

=option  trusted BOOLEAN
=default trusted <false>

Is this message from a trusted source?  If not, the content must be
checked before use.  This checking will be performed when the
body data is decoded or used for transmission.

=option  deleted BOOLEAN
=default deleted <false>
Is the file deleted from the start?

=option  labels ARRAY|HASH
=default labels {}
Initial values of the labels.  In case of M<Mail::Box::Message>'s, this
shall reflect the state the message is in.  For newly constructed
M<Mail::Message>'s, this may be anything you want, because M<coerce()>
will take care of the folder specifics once the message is added to one.

=cut

sub init($)
{   my ($self, $args) = @_;
    $self->SUPER::init($args);

    # Field initializations also in coerce()
    $self->{MM_modified} = $args->{modified}  || 0;
    $self->{MM_trusted}  = $args->{trusted}   || 0;

    # Set the header

    my $head;
    if(defined($head = $args->{head})) { $self->head($head) }
    elsif(my $msgid = $args->{messageId} || $args->{messageID})
    {   $self->takeMessageId($msgid);
    }

    # Set the body
    if(my $body = $args->{body})
    {   $self->{MM_body} = $body;
        $body->message($self);
    }

    $self->{MM_body_type} = $args->{body_type}
       if defined $args->{body_type};

    $self->{MM_head_type} = $args->{head_type}
       if defined $args->{head_type};

    $self->{MM_field_type} = $args->{field_type}
       if defined $args->{field_type};

    my $labels = $args->{labels} || [];
    my @labels = ref $labels eq 'ARRAY' ? @$labels : %$labels;
    push @labels, deleted => $args->{deleted} if exists $args->{deleted};
    $self->{MM_labels} = { @labels };

    $self;
}

=method clone %options

Create a copy of this message.  Returned is a C<Mail::Message> object.
The head and body, the log and trace levels are taken.  Labels are
copied with the message, but the delete and modified flags are not.
 
BE WARNED: the clone of any kind of message (or a message part)
will B<always> be a C<Mail::Message> object.  For example, a
M<Mail::Box::Message>'s clone is detached from the folder of its original.
When you use M<Mail::Box::addMessage()> with the cloned message at hand,
then the clone will automatically be coerced into the right message type
to be added.

See also M<Mail::Box::Message::copyTo()> and M<Mail::Box::Message::moveTo()>.

=option  shallow BOOLEAN
=default shallow <false>
When a shallow clone is made, the header and body of the message will not
be cloned, but shared.  This is quite dangerous: for instance in some
folder types, the header fields are used to store folder flags.  When
one of both shallow clones change the flags, that will update the header
and thereby be visible in both.

There are situations where a shallow clone can be used safely.  For instance,
when M<Mail::Box::Message::moveTo()> is used and you are sure that the
original message cannot get undeleted after the move.

=option  shallow_head BOOLEAN
=default shallow_head <false>
Only the head uses is reused, not the body.  This is probably a bad choice,
because the header fields can be updated, for instance when labels change.

=option  shallow_body BOOLEAN
=default shallow_body <false>
A rather safe bet, because you are not allowed to modify the body of a
message: you may only set a new body with M<body()>.

=example
 $copy = $msg->clone;

=cut

sub clone(@)
{   my ($self, %args) = @_;

    # First clone body, which may trigger head load as well.  If head is
    # triggered first, then it may be decided to be lazy on the body at
    # moment.  And then the body would be triggered.

    my ($head, $body) = ($self->head, $self->body);
    $head = $head->clone
       unless $args{shallow} || $args{shallow_head};

    $body = $body->clone
       unless $args{shallow} || $args{shallow_body};

    my $clone = Mail::Message->new
     ( head  => $head
     , body  => $body
     , $self->logSettings
     );

    my $labels = $self->labels;
    my %labels = %$labels;
    delete $labels{deleted};

    $clone->{MM_labels} = \%labels;

    $clone->{MM_cloned} = $self;
    weaken($clone->{MM_cloned});

    $clone;
}

#------------------------------------------

=section Constructing a message

=section The message

=method messageId
Retrieve the message's id.  Every message has a unique message-id.  This id
is used mainly for recognizing discussion threads.
=cut

sub messageId() { $_[0]->{MM_message_id} || $_[0]->takeMessageId}
sub messageID() {shift->messageId}   # compatibility

=method container
If the message is a part of another message, C<container> returns the
reference to the containing body.
=examples

 my Mail::Message $msg = ...
 return unless $msg->body->isMultipart;
 my $part   = $msg->body->part(2);

 return unless $part->body->isMultipart;
 my $nested = $part->body->part(3);

 $nested->container;  # returns $msg->body
 $nested->toplevel;   # returns $msg
 $msg->container;     # returns undef
 $msg->toplevel;      # returns $msg
 $msg->isPart;        # returns false
 $part->isPart;       # returns true
=cut

sub container() { undef } # overridden by Mail::Message::Part

=method isPart
Returns true if the message is a part of another message.  This is
the case for M<Mail::Message::Part> extensions of C<Mail::Message>.
=cut

sub isPart() { 0 } # overridden by Mail::Message::Part

=method partNumber
Returns a string representing the location of this part.  In case the
top message is a single message, 'undef' is returned.  When it is a
multipart, '1' up to the number of multiparts is returned.  A multi-level
nested part may for instance return '2.5.1'.

Usually, this string is very short.  Numbering follows the IMAP4 design,
see RFC2060 section 6.4.5.
=cut

sub partNumber()
{   my $self = shift;
    my $cont = $self->container;
    $cont ? $cont->partNumber : undef;
}

=method toplevel
Returns a reference to the main message, which will be the current
message if the message is not part of another message.
=cut

sub toplevel() { shift } # overridden by Mail::Message::Part

=method isDummy
Dummy messages are used to fill holes in linked-list and such, where only
a message-id is known, but not the place of the header of body data.

This method is also available for M<Mail::Message::Dummy> objects,
where this will return C<true>.  On any extension of C<Mail::Message>,
this will return C<false>.
=cut

sub isDummy() { 0 }

=method print [$fh]
Print the message to the FILE-HANDLE, which defaults to the selected
filehandle, without the encapsulation sometimes required by a folder
type, like M<write()> does.

=examples
 $message->print(\*STDERR);  # to the error output
 $message->print;            # to the selected file

 my $out = IO::File->new('out', 'w');
 $message->print($out);      # no encapsulation: no folder
 $message->write($out);      # with encapsulation: is folder.
=cut

sub print(;$)
{   my $self = shift;
    my $out  = shift || select;

    $self->head->print($out);
    my $body = $self->body;
    $body->print($out) if $body;
    $self;
}

=method write [$fh]
Write the message to the FILE-HANDLE, which defaults to the selected
$fh, with all surrounding information which is needed to put
it correctly in a folder file.

In most cases, the result of C<write> will be the same as with M<print()>.
The main exception is for Mbox folder messages, which will get printed
with their leading 'From ' line and a trailing blank.  Each line of
their body which starts with 'From ' will have an 'E<gt>' added in front.
=cut

sub write(;$)
{   my $self = shift;
    my $out  = shift || select;

    $self->head->print($out);
    $self->body->print($out);
    $self;
}

=method send [$mailer], %options
Transmit the message to anything outside this Perl program.  Returns
false when sending failed even after retries.

The optional $mailer is a M<Mail::Transport::Send> object.  When the
$mailer is not specified, one will be created and kept as default for
the next messages as well.

The %options are mailer specific, and a mixture of what is usable for
the creation of the mailer object and the sending itself.  Therefore, see
for possible options M<Mail::Transport::Send::new()> and
M<Mail::Transport::Send::send()>.  That object also provides a C<trySend()>
method which gives more low-level control.

=example
 $message->send;

is short (but little less flexibile) for

 my $mailer = M<Mail::Transport::SMTP>->new(@smtpopts);
 $mailer->send($message, @sendopts);

See examples/send.pl in the distribution of M<Mail::Box>.

=example
 $message->send(via => 'sendmail')

=error No default mailer found to send message.
The message M<send()> mechanism had not enough information to automatically
find a mail transfer agent to sent this message.  Specify a mailer
explicitly using the C<via> options.

=cut

my $default_mailer;

sub send(@)
{   my $self = shift;

	# Loosely coupled module
    require Mail::Transport::Send;

    my $mailer;
    $default_mailer = $mailer = shift
        if ref $_[0] && $_[0]->isa('Mail::Transport::Send');

    my %args = @_;
    if( ! $args{via} && defined $default_mailer )
    {   $mailer = $default_mailer;
    }
    else
    {   my $via = delete $args{via} || 'sendmail';
        $default_mailer = $mailer = Mail::Transport->new(via => $via, %args);
    }

    $mailer->send($self, %args);
}

=method size

Returns an estimated size of the whole message in bytes.  In many occasions,
the functions which process the message further, for instance M<send()>
or M<print()> will need to add/change header lines or add CR characters,
so the size is only an estimate with a few percent margin of the real
result.

The computation assumes that each line ending is represented by one
character (like UNIX, MacOS, and sometimes Cygwin), and not two characters
(like Windows and sometimes Cygwin).  If you write the message to file on
a system which uses CR and LF to end a single line (all Windows versions),
the result in that file will be at least M<nrLines()> larger than this
method returns.

=cut

sub size()
{   my $self = shift;
    $self->head->size + $self->body->size;
}

#------------------------------------------

=section The header

=method head [$head]
Return (optionally after setting) the $head of this message.
The head must be an (sub-)class of M<Mail::Message::Head>.
When the head is added, status information is taken from it
and transformed into labels.  More labels can be added by the
LABELS hash.  They are added later.

=example
 my $header = M<Mail::Message::Head>->new;
 $msg->head($header);    # set
 my $head = $msg->head;  # get
=cut

sub head(;$)
{   my $self = shift;
    return $self->{MM_head} unless @_;

    my $head = shift;
    unless(defined $head)
    {   delete $self->{MM_head};
        return undef;
    }

    $self->log(INTERNAL => "wrong type of head ($head) for message $self")
        unless ref $head && $head->isa('Mail::Message::Head');

    $head->message($self);

    if(my $old = $self->{MM_head})
    {   $self->{MM_modified}++ unless $old->isDelayed;
    }

    $self->{MM_head} = $head;

    $self->takeMessageId unless $head->isDelayed;

    $head;
}

=method get $fieldname

Returns the value which is stored in the header field with the specified
name.  The $fieldname is case insensitive.  The I<unfolded body> of the
field is returned, stripped from any attributes.
See M<Mail::Message::Field::body()>.

If the field has multiple appearances in the header, only the last
instance is returned.  If you need more complex handing of fields, then
call M<Mail::Message::Head::get()> yourself.  See M<study()> when you
want to be smart, doing the better (but slower) job.

=example the get() short-cut for header fields

 print $msg->get('Content-Type'), "\n";

Is equivalent to:

 print $msg->head->get('Content-Type')->body, "\n";

=cut

sub get($)
{   my $self  = shift;
    my $field = $self->head->get(shift) || return undef;
    $field->body;
}

=method study $fieldname
Study the content of a field, like M<get()> does, with as main difference
that a M<Mail::Message::Field::Full> object is returned.  These objects
stringify to an utf8 decoded representation of the data contained in
the field, where M<get()> does not decode.  When the field does not exist,
then C<undef> is returned.  See M<Mail::Message::Field::study()>.

=example the study() short-cut for header fields
 print $msg->study('to'), "\n";

Is equivalent to:

 print $msg->head->study('to'), "\n";       # and
 print $msg->head->get('to')->study, "\n";

or better:
 if(my $to = $msg->study('to')) { print "$to\n" }
 if(my $to = $msg->get('to')) { print $to->study, "\n" }
=cut

sub study($)
{  my $head = shift->head or return;
   scalar $head->study(@_);    # return only last
}

=method from
Returns the addresses from the senders.  It is possible to have more than
one address specified in the C<From> field of the message, according
to the specification. Therefore a list of M<Mail::Address> objects is
returned, which usually has length 1.

If you need only one address from a sender, for instance to create a
"original message by" line in constructed forwarded message body, then use
M<sender()>.

=example using from() to get all sender addresses

 my @from = $message->from;
=cut

sub from()
{  my @from = shift->head->get('From') or return ();
   map $_->addresses, @from;
}

=method sender
Returns exactly one address, which is the originator of this message.
The returned M<Mail::Address> object is taken from the C<Sender> header
field, unless that field does not exists, in which case the first
address from the C<From> field is taken.  If none of both provide
an address, C<undef> is returned.

=example using sender() to get exactly one sender address
 my $sender = $message->sender;
 print "Reply to: ", $sender->format, "\n" if defined $sender;

=cut

sub sender()
{   my $self   = shift;
    my $sender = $self->head->get('Sender') || $self->head->get('From')
               || return ();

    ($sender->addresses)[0];                 # first specified address
}

=method to
Returns the addresses which are specified on the C<To> header line (or lines).
A list of M<Mail::Address> objects is returned.  The people addressed
here are the targets of the content, and should read it contents
carefully.

=examples using to() to get all primar destination addresses

 my @to = $message->to;
=cut

sub to() { map $_->addresses, shift->head->get('To') }

=method cc
Returns the addresses which are specified on the C<Cc> header line (or lines)
A list of M<Mail::Address> objects is returned.  C<Cc> stands for
I<Carbon Copy>; the people addressed on this line receive the message
informational, and are usually not expected to reply on its content.
=cut

sub cc() { map $_->addresses, shift->head->get('Cc') }

=method bcc
Returns the addresses which are specified on the C<Bcc> header line (or lines)
A list of M<Mail::Address> objects is returned.
C<Bcc> stands for I<Blind Carbon Copy>: destinations of the message which are
not listed in the messages actually sent.  So, this field will be empty
for received messages, but may be present in messages you construct yourself.
=cut

sub bcc() { map $_->addresses, shift->head->get('Bcc') }

=method date
Method has been removed for reasons of consistency.  Use M<timestamp()>
or C<< $msg->head->get('Date') >>.

=method destinations
Returns a list of M<Mail::Address> objects which contains the combined
info of active C<To>, C<Cc>, and C<Bcc> addresses.  Double addresses are
removed if detectable.
=cut

sub destinations()
{   my $self = shift;
    my %to = map +(lc($_->address) => $_), $self->to, $self->cc, $self->bcc;
    values %to;
}

=method subject
Returns the message's subject, or the empty string.  The subject may
have encoded characters in it; use M<study()> to get rit of that.

=example using subject() to get the message's subject
 print $msg->subject;
 print $msg->study('subject');
=cut

sub subject()
{   my $subject = shift->get('subject');
    defined $subject ? $subject : '';
}

=method guessTimestamp
Return an estimate on the time this message was sent.  The data is
derived from the header, where it can be derived from the C<date> and
C<received> lines.  For MBox-like folders you may get the date from
the from-line as well.

This method may return C<undef> if the header is not parsed or only
partially known.  If you require a time, then use the M<timestamp()>
method, described below.

=example using guessTimestamp() to get a transmission date
 print "Receipt ", ($message->timestamp || 'unknown'), "\n";

=cut

sub guessTimestamp() {shift->head->guessTimestamp}

=method timestamp
Get a good timestamp for the message, doesn't matter how much work it is.
The value returned is compatible with the platform dependent result of
function time().

In these days, the timestamp as supplied by the message (in the C<Date>
field) is not trustable at all: many spammers produce illegal or
unreal dates to influence their location in the displayed folder.

To start, the received headers are tried for a date (see
M<Mail::Message::Head::Complete::recvstamp()>) and only then the C<Date>
field.  In very rare cases, only with some locally produced messages,
no stamp can be found.

=cut

sub timestamp()
{   my $head = shift->head;
    $head->recvstamp || $head->timestamp;
}

=method nrLines
Returns the number of lines used for the whole message.
=cut

sub nrLines()
{   my $self = shift;
    $self->head->nrLines + $self->body->nrLines;
}

#-------------------------------------------

=section The body

=method body [$body]
Return the body of this message.  BE WARNED that this returns
you an object which may be encoded: use decoded() to get a body
with usable data.

With options, a new $body is set for this message.  This is B<not>
for normal use unless you understand the consequences: you change
the message content without changing the message-ID.  The right
way to go is via

 $message = M<Mail::Message>->buildFromBody($body);  # or
 $message = M<Mail::Message>->build($body);          # or
 $message = $origmsg->forward(body => $body);

The $body must be an (sub-)class of M<Mail::Message::Body>.  In this case,
information from the specified body will be copied into the header.  The
body object will be encoded if needed, because messages written to file
or transmitted shall not contain binary data.  The converted body
is returned.

When $body is C<undef>, the current message body will be dissected from
the message.  All relation will be cut.  The body is returned, and
can be connected to a different message.

=examples

 my $body      = $msg->body;
 my @encoded   = $msg->body->lines;

 my $new       = M<Mail::Message::Body>->new(mime_type => 'text/html');
 my $converted = $msg->body($new);

=cut
  
sub body(;$@)
{   my $self = shift;
    return $self->{MM_body} unless @_;

    my $head = $self->head;
    $head->removeContentInfo if defined $head;

    my ($rawbody, %args) = @_;
    unless(defined $rawbody)
    {   # Disconnect body from message.
        my $body = delete $self->{MM_body};
        $body->message(undef) if defined $body;
        return $body;
    }

    ref $rawbody && $rawbody->isa('Mail::Message::Body')
        or $self->log(INTERNAL => "wrong type of body for message $rawbody");

    # Bodies of real messages must be encoded for safe transmission.
    # Message parts will get encoded on the moment the whole multipart
    # is transformed into a real message.

    my $body = $self->isPart ? $rawbody : $rawbody->encoded;
    $body->contentInfoTo($self->head);

    my $oldbody = $self->{MM_body};
    return $body if defined $oldbody && $body==$oldbody;

    $body->message($self);
    $body->modified(1) if defined $oldbody;

    $self->{MM_body} = $body;
}

=method decoded %options
Decodes the body of this message, and returns it as a body object.
Short for C<< $msg->body->decoded >>  All %options are passed-on.
=cut

sub decoded(@)
{   my $body = shift->body->load;
    $body ? $body->decoded(@_) : undef;
}

=method encode %options
Encode the message to a certain format.  Read the details in the
dedicated manual page M<Mail::Message::Body::Encode>.  The %options which
can be specified here are those of the M<Mail::Message::Body::encode()>
method.  
=cut

sub encode(@)
{   my $body = shift->body->load;
    $body ? $body->encode(@_) : undef;
}

=method isMultipart
Check whether this message is a multipart message (has attachments).  To
find this out, we need at least the header of the message; there is no
need to read the body of the message to detect this.
=cut

sub isMultipart() {shift->head->isMultipart}

=method isNested
Returns C<true> for C<message/rfc822> messages and message parts.
=cut

sub isNested() {shift->body->isNested}

=method contentType
Returns the content type header line, or C<text/plain> if it is not
defined.  The parameters will be stripped off.
=cut

sub contentType()
{   my $head = shift->head;
    my $ct   = (defined $head ? $head->get('Content-Type', 0) : undef) || '';
    $ct      =~ s/\s*\;.*//;
    length $ct ? $ct : 'text/plain';

=method parts [<'ALL'|'ACTIVE'|'DELETED'|'RECURSE'|$filter>]
Returns the I<parts> of this message.  Maybe a bit inconvenient: it
returns the message itself when it is not a multipart.

Usually, the term I<part> is used with I<multipart> messages: messages
which are encapsulated in the body of a message.  To abstract this
concept: this method will return you all header-body combinations
which are stored within this message B<except> the multipart and
message/rfc822 wrappers.  Objects returned are C<Mail::Message>'s and
M<Mail::Message::Part>'s.

The option default to 'ALL', which will return the message itself for
single-parts, the nested content of a message/rfc822 object, respectively
the parts of a multipart without recursion.  In case of 'RECURSE', the
parts of multiparts will be collected recursively.  This option cannot
be combined with the other options, which you may want: it that case
you have to test yourself.

'ACTIVE' and 'DELETED' check for the deleted flag on messages and
message parts.  The $filter is a code reference, which is called for
each part of the message; each part as C<RECURSE> would return.

=examples
 my @parts = $msg->parts;           # $msg not multipart: returns ($msg)
 my $parts = $msg->parts('ACTIVE'); # returns ($msg)

 $msg->delete;
 my @parts = $msg->parts;           # returns ($msg)
 my $parts = $msg->parts('ACTIVE'); # returns ()

=method modified [BOOLEAN]
Returns (optionally after setting) whether this message is flagged as
being modified.  See isModified().
=cut

sub modified(;$)

    return $self->isModified unless @_;  # compatibility 2.036

    my $flag = shift;
    $self->{MM_modified} = $flag;
    my $head = $self->head;
    $head->modified($flag) if $head;
    my $body = $self->body;
    $body->modified($flag) if $body;

    $flag;
}

=method isModified
Returns whether this message is flagged as being modified.  Modifications
are changes in header lines, when a new body is set to the message
(dangerous), or when labels change.
=cut

sub isModified()
{   my $self = shift;
    return 1 if $self->{MM_modified};

    my $head = $self->head;
    if($head && $head->isModified)
    {   $self->{MM_modified}++;
        return 1;
    }

    my $body = $self->body;
    if($body && $body->isModified)
    {   $self->{MM_modified}++;
        return 1;
    }

    0;
}

=method label $label|PAIRS
Return the value of the $label, optionally after setting some values.  In
case of setting values, you specify key-value PAIRS.

Labels are used to store knowledge about handling of the message within
the folder.  Flags about whether a message was read, replied to, or
scheduled for deletion.

Some labels are taken from the header's C<Status> and C<X-Status> lines.
Folder types like MH define a separate label file, and Maildir adds
letters to the message filename.  But the MailBox labels are always the
same.

=examples
 print $message->label('seen');
 if($message->label('seen')) {...};
 $message->label(seen => 1);

 $message->label(deleted => 1);  # same as $message->delete

=cut

sub label($;$@)
{   my $self   = shift;
    return $self->{MM_labels}{$_[0]} unless @_ > 1;
    my $return = $_[1];

    my %labels = @_;
    @{$self->{MM_labels}}{keys %labels} = values %labels;
    $return;
}

=method labels
Returns all known labels. In SCALAR context, it returns the knowledge
as reference to a hash.  This is a reference to the original data, but
you shall *not* change that data directly: call C<label> for
changes!

In LIST context, you get a list of names which are defined.  Be warned
that they will not all evaluate to true, although most of them will.
=cut

sub labels()
{   my $self = shift;
    wantarray ? keys %{$self->{MM_labels}} : $self->{MM_labels};
}

=method isDeleted
Short-cut for
 $msg->label('deleted')

For some folder types, you will get the time of deletion in return.  This
depends on the implementation.

=examples
 next if $message->isDeleted;

 if(my $when = $message->isDeleted) {
    print scalar localtime $when;
 }

=cut

sub isDeleted() { shift->label('deleted') }

=method delete
Flag the message to be deleted, which is a shortcut for
 $msg->label(deleted => time);
The real deletion only takes place on a synchronization of the folder.
See M<deleted()> as well.

The time stamp of the moment of deletion is stored as value, but that
is not always preserved in the folder (depends on the implementation).
When the same message is deleted more than once, the first time stamp
will stay.

=examples
 $message->delete;
 $message->deleted(1);  # exactly the same
 $message->label(deleted => 1);
 delete $message;
=cut

sub delete()
{  my $self = shift;
   my $old = $self->label('deleted');
   $old || $self->label(deleted => time);
}

=method deleted [BOOLEAN]
Set the delete flag for this message.  Without argument, the method
returns the same as M<isDeleted()>, which is preferred.  When a true
value is given, M<delete()> is called.

=examples
 $message->deleted(1);          # delete
 $message->delete;              # delete (preferred)

 $message->deleted(0);          # undelete

 if($message->deleted) {...}    # check
 if($message->isDeleted) {...}  # check (preferred)
=cut

sub deleted(;$)
{   my $self = shift;

    @_ ? $self->label(deleted => shift)
       : $self->label('deleted')   # compat 2.036
}

=method labelsToStatus
When the labels were changed, that may effect the C<Status> and/or
C<X-Status> header lines of mbox messages.  Read about the relation
between these fields and the labels in the DETAILS chapter.

The method will carefully only affect the result of M<modified()> when
there is a real change of flags, so not for each call to M<label()>.
=cut

sub labelsToStatus()
{   my $self    = shift;
    my $head    = $self->head;
    my $labels  = $self->labels;

    my $status  = $head->get('status') || '';
    my $newstatus
      = $labels->{seen}    ? 'RO'
      : $labels->{old}     ? 'O'
      : '';

    $head->set(Status => $newstatus)
        if $newstatus ne $status;

    my $xstatus = $head->get('x-status') || '';
    my $newxstatus
      = ($labels->{replied} ? 'A' : '')
      . ($labels->{flagged} ? 'F' : '');

    $head->set('X-Status' => $newxstatus)
        if $newxstatus ne $xstatus;

    $self;
}

=method statusToLabels
Update the labels according the status lines in the header.  See the
description in the DETAILS chapter.
=cut

sub statusToLabels()
{   my $self    = shift;
    my $head    = $self->head;

    if(my $status  = $head->get('status'))

        $self->label
         ( seen    => (index($status, 'R') >= 0)
         , old     => (index($status, 'O') >= 0)
	 );
    }

=section Internals

=c_method coerce $message, %options
Coerce a $message into a Mail::Message.  In some occasions, for instance
where you add a message to a folder, this coercion is automatically
called to ensure that the correct message type is stored.

The coerced message is returned on success, otherwise C<undef>.  The
coerced message may be a reblessed version of the original message
or a new object.  In case the message has to be specialized, for
instance from a general Mail::Message into a M<Mail::Box::Mbox::Message>,
no copy is needed.  However, to coerce a M<Mail::Internet> object into
a Mail::Message, a lot of copying and converting will take place.

Valid MESSAGEs which can be coerced into Mail::Message objects
are of type

=over 4
=item * Any type of M<Mail::Box::Message>
=item * M<MIME::Entity> objects, using M<Mail::Message::Convert::MimeEntity>
=item * M<Mail::Internet> objects, using M<Mail::Message::Convert::MailInternet>
=item * M<Email::Simple> objects, using M<Mail::Message::Convert::EmailSimple>
=item * M<Email::Abstract> objects
=back

M<Mail::Message::Part>'s, which are extensions of C<Mail::Message>'s,
can also be coerced directly from a M<Mail::Message::Body>.

=examples
 my $folder  = Mail::Box::Mbox->new;
 my $message = Mail::Message->build(...);

 my $coerced = Mail::Box::Mbox::Message->coerce($message);

the mime-type and encodings of the body data.

The $bodytype determines which kind of body will be made and defaults to
the value specified by new(body_type).

=chapter DETAILS

=section Structure of a Message

A MIME-compliant message is build upon two parts: the I<header> and the
I<body>.

=subsection The header

The header is a list of fields, some spanning more than one line
(I<folded>) each telling something about the message. Information stored
in here are for instance the sender of the message, the receivers of
the message, when it was transported, how it was transported, etc.
Headers can grow quite large.

In MailBox, each message object manages exactly one header object
(a M<Mail::Message::Head>) and one body object (a M<Mail::Message::Body>).
The header contains a list of header fields, which are represented by
M<Mail::Message::Field> objects.

=subsection The body

The body contains the "payload": the data to be transferred.
The data can be encoded, only accessible with a specific application,
and may use some weird character-set, like Vietnamese; the MailBox
distribution tries to assist you with handling these e-mails without
the need to know all the details.  This additional information
("meta-information") about the body data is stored in the header.
The header contains more information, for instance about the message
transport and relations to other messages.

=section Message object implementation

The general idea about the structure of a message is

 M<Mail::Message>
  |  |
  |  `-has-one--M<Mail::Message::Body>
  |
  `----has-one--M<Mail::Message::Head>
                  |
                  `-has-many--M<Mail::Message::Field>

However: there are about 7 kinds of body objects, 3 kinds of headers and
3 kinds of fields.  You will usually not see too much of these kinds,
because they are merely created for performance reasons and can be used
all the same, with the exception of the multipart bodies.

A multipart body is either a M<Mail::Message::Body::Multipart>
(mime type C<multipart/*>) or a M<Mail::Message::Body::Nested>
(mime type C<message/rfc822>).  These bodies are more complex:

 M<Mail::Message::Body::Multipart>
  |
  `-has-many--M<Mail::Message::Part>
               |  |
               |  `-has-one--M<Mail::Message::Body>
               |
               `----has-one--M<Mail::Message::Head>

Before you try to reconstruct multiparts or nested messages yourself,
you can better take a look at M<Mail::Message::Construct::Rebuild>.

=section Message class implementation

The class structure of messages is very close to that of folders.  For
instance, a M<Mail::Box::File::Message> relates to a M<Mail::Box::File>
folder.

As extra level of inheritance, it has a M<Mail::Message>, which
is a message without location.  And there is a special case of
message: M<Mail::Message::Part> is a message encapsulated in a
multipart body.

The message types are:

 M<Mail::Box::Mbox::Message>            M<Mail::Box::POP3::Message>
 |  M<Mail::Box::Dbx::Message>      M<Mail::Box::IMAP4::Message>  |
 |  |                                                    |  |
 M<Mail::Box::File::Message>             M<Mail::Box::Net::Message>
         |                                      |
         |       M<Mail::Box::Maildir::Message>    |
         |       |   M<Mail::Box::MH::Message>     |
         |       |   |                          |
         |       M<Mail::Box::Dir::Message>        |
         |                |                     |
         `------------.   |   .-----------------'
                      |   |   |
                   M<Mail::Box::Message>    M<Mail::Message::Part>
                          |                     |

                          |
                    M<Mail::Reporter> (general base class)

By far most folder features are implemented in M<Mail::Box>, so
available to all folder types.  Sometimes, features which appear
in only some of the folder types are simulated for folders that miss
them, like sub-folder support for MBOX.

Two strange other message types are defined:
the M<Mail::Message::Dummy>, which fills holes in
M<Mail::Box::Thread::Node> lists, and a M<Mail::Box::Message::Destructed>,
this is an on purpose demolished message to reduce memory consumption.

=section Labels

Labels (also named "Flags") are used to indicate some special condition on
the message, primary targeted on organizational issues: which messages are
already read or should be deleted.  There is a very strong user relation
to labels.

The main complication is that each folder type has its own way of storing
labels.  To give an indication: MBOX folders use C<Status> and C<X-Status>
header fields, MH uses a C<.mh-sequences> file, MAILDIR encodes the flags
in the message's filename, and IMAP has flags as part of the protocol.

Besides, some folder types can store labels with user defined names,
where other lack that feature.  Some folders have case-insensitive
labels, other don't. Read all about the specifics in the manual page of
the message type you actually have.

=subsection Predefined labels

To standardize the folder types, MailBox has defined the following labels,
which can be used with the M<label()> and M<labels()> methods on all kinds
of messages:

=over 4

=item * deleted

This message is flagged to be deleted once the folder closes.  Be very
careful about the concept of 'delete' in a folder context : it is only a
flag, and does not involve immediate action!  This means, for instance,
that the memory which is used by Perl to store the message is not released
immediately (see M<destruct()> if you need to).

The methods M<delete()>, M<deleted()>, and M<isDeleted()> are only
short-cuts for managing the C<delete> label (as of MailBox 2.052).

=item * draft

The user has prepared this message, but is has not been send (yet).  This
flag is not automatically added to a message by MailBox, and has only
a meaning in user applications.

=item * flagged

Messages can be I<flagged> for some purpose, for instance as result of
a search for spam in a folder.  The M<Mail::Box::messages()> method
can be used to collect all these flagged messages from the folder.

Probably it is more useful to use an understandable name (like C<spam>)
for these selections, however these self-defined labels can not stored
in all folder types.

=item * old

The message was already in the folder when it was opened the last time,
so was not recently added to the folder.  This flag will never automatically
be set by MailBox, because it would probably conflict with the user's
idea of what is old.

=item * passed

Not often used or kept, this flag indicates that the message was bounced
or forwarded to someone else.

=item * replied

The user (or application) has sent a message back to the sender of
the message, as response of this one.  This flag is automatically
set if you use M<reply()>, but not with M<forward()> or M<bounce()>.

=item * seen

When this flag is set, the receiver of the message has consumed the message.
A mail user agent (MUA) will set this flag when the user has opened the
message once.

=back

=subsection Status and X-Status fields

Mbox folders have no special means of storing information about messages
(except the message separator line), and therefore have to revert to
adding fields to the message header when something special comes up.
This feature is also enabled for POP3, although whether that works
depends on the POP server.

All applications which can handle mbox folders support the C<Status> and
C<X-Status> field convensions.  The following encoding is used:

 Flag   Field       Label
 R      Status   => seen    (Read)
 O      Status   => old     (not recent)
 A      X-Status => replied (Answered)
 F      X-Status => flagged

There is no special flag for C<deleted>, which most other folders support:
messages flagged to be deleted will never be written to a folder file when
it is closed.
