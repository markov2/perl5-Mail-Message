<H1>Life according to Brian</H1>

This is normal text, but not in a paragraph.<P>New paragraph
in a bad way.

And this is just a continuation.  When texts get long, they must be
auto-wrapped; and even that is working already.

<H3>Silly subsection at once</H3>
<H1>and another chapter</H1>
<H2>again a section</H2>
<P>Normal paragraph, which contains an <IMG
SRC=image.gif>, some
<I>italics with linebreak
</I> and <TT>code</TT>

<PRE>
And now for the preformatted stuff
   it should stay as it was
      even   with   strange blanks
  and indentations
</PRE>

And back to normal text...
