=chapter NAME

Mail::Message::Field::Fast - one line of a message header

=chapter SYNOPSIS

 See M<Mail::Message::Field>

=chapter DESCRIPTION

This is the faster, but less flexible implementation of a header field.
The data is stored in an array, and some hacks are made to speeds
things up.  Be gentle with me, and consider that each message contains
many of these lines, so speed is very important here.

=chapter METHODS

=cut

#------------------------------------------
#
# The DATA is stored as:   [ NAME, FOLDED-BODY ]
# The body is kept in a folded fashion, where each line starts with
# a single blank.

=c_method new $data

The constructor of this object does not follow the usual practise within
the Mail::Box suite: it does not use the constructor
M<Mail::Reporter::new()>.
Therefor it has no logging or tracing facilities.

The method can be used in one of the following ways:

=over 4

=item * B<new> LINE

Pass a LINE as it could be found in a file: a (possibly folded) line
which is terminated by a new-line.

=item * B<new> NAME, (BODY|OBJECTS), [ATTRIBUTES]

A set of values which shape the line.

=back

Create a new header field object.  Specify the whole LINE at once, and
it will be split-up for you.  I case you already have the parts of the
header line, you may specify them separately as NAME and BODY.

In case you specify a single OBJECT, or a reference to an array of
OBJECTS, these objects are processed to become suitable to fill a
field, usually by simple strification.  When you specify one or more
M<Mail::Address> objects, these are transformed into a string using
their C<format> method.  You may also add one M<Mail::Message::Field>,
whose body is taken.  In case of an array, the elements are joined into
one string with a comma.

ATTRIBUTES can be exactly one string which may contain multiple attributes
at once, quoted and formatted as required in RFC2822.  As alternative,
list of key-value pairs can be used.  In this case, the values will get
quoted if needed and everything formatted as the protocol demands.

=examples

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII');

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  'Content-Type' => 'text/plain; charset=US-ASCII');

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  'Content-Type' => 'text/plain', 'charset=US-ASCII');

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  'Content-Type' => 'text/plain', charset => 'Latin1');

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  To => Mail::Address->new('My', 'me@example.com');

 my $mime = Mail::Message::Field->new(
  Cc => [ Mail::Address->new('You', 'you@example.com')
        , Mail::Address->new('His', 'he@example.com')
        ]);

But in practice, you can simply call

 my $head = Mail::Message::Head->new;
 $head->add( 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'
           , charset => 'utf8');

which implicitly calls this constructor (when needed).  You can specify
the same things for M<Mail::Message::Head::Complete::add()> as this
C<new> accepts.
