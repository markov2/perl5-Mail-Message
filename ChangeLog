	  the whole remaining line, not fail parsing.

	  and writing bodies.  GitHub#12 [Jacob Balazer]

	  the default interpretation was 'us-ascii' for reading and 'utf-8'
	  for writing.

	- ::Field::Full consumePhrase() should take minimal encoded
	  phrase [Jonas Ryssel]

	  trailing boundery, then there is a epilogue.

	- run regression-tests with MIME::Entity on devel system.
	- ::Body->decode autodects missing charset.
	- The ability to set the charset detector via ::Body::Encode
	  method charsetDetectAlgorithm()
